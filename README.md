# Deployment
The project was deployed on GitHub Pages. I used Gitpod as a development environment where I committed all changes to git version control system. I used push command in Gitpod to save changes into GitHub.

* Select `Settings` and find the Pages section at the second to bottom of the page's navigation menu on the left hand side of the screen. 
* From source select branch `main` and then the `root` folder.
* Click `save` and page was deployed after auto-refresh.
